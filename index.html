            <h2>Introduction </h2>
          </div>
      <p>This is my first website. I am new to all of this and my intention with this assigment is to build some kind of template or simple structure for a project website that i would like to build/create in the near future</p>
      <p>I am triying to build a website with the look and feel of this one <a href="http://www.simplyrace.co.uk/" target="_blank">Simply Race</a> beacuse it is a responsive, simple and well organized webpage that looks amazing to me and also has something to do with my project</p>
      <p>Also, I am going to be using several and different HTML elements to practice and see how they look in the web browser</p>

        <h2>The Project: Simulator Racing Venue </h2>
      </div>
      <article>
        <p>The idea is to interconnect more than four(4) Sim Racing Stations to the same videogame/platform so people can Race/Compete in a Car Racing simmulator, using life like hardware that inmerse you in the game like if you were a real car pilot competing for 1st place in any virtual circuit around the world.</p>
        <p>This is a project that is running in my head for many years but it is more difficult than it seems. There are a lot different variables like the differents types of platforms, hardware, software, business models to name a few that makes this a very risky business idea.</p> 
        <p>I have reserached a lot of this topic and many similar projects(business) just last between 1 to 2 years but it is just a matter of time before someone could find the sweet spot and make this amazing idea a profitable and fun one.</p>
